I am a PhD student in [Agricultural and Resource Economics](http://www.are.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley and a Doctoral Fellow in the [Global Policy Laboratory](http://www.globalpolicy.science/). I am an environmental economics studying adaptation to climate change. I have a strong interdisciplinary interest in machine learning and remote sensing for quantitative social science applications. Prior to starting graduate school, I was a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at the [Energy Policy Institute at UChicago](https://epic.uchicago.edu/), where I worked in the [Climate Impact Lab](http://www.impactlab.org).
